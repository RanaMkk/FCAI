# Logistic Regression Model Implementation in Python

## Introduction
This Python file implements a logistic regression model. Logistic regression is a classification algorithm that predicts the probability of an instance belonging to a particular class.

## Code Overview

### Sigmoid Function
The logistic regression model relies on the sigmoid function (σ(z)) to compute the probability of the instance belonging to a class.

### Initializing Parameters
Initialize weights (θ) and bias (b) to zero.

### Linear Combination
Compute the linear combination (z = θ1x1 + θ2x2 + … + θnxn + b).

### Cost Function
Define the cost function (J(θ) = − 1/m∑[y(i)log(y) + (1−y)log(1− y)]).

### Prediction
Make predictions using the sigmoid function.

### Gradient Descent
Update weights and bias using gradient descent.

### Accuracy Calculation
A function to calculate the accuracy of the model.

## Conclusion
This implementation provides a basic understanding of logistic regression and its key components such as the sigmoid function, parameter initialization, cost function, and gradient descent for optimization.
