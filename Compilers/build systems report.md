# Comprehensive Report on Build Systems and Package Managers in the .NET Environment

## Introduction:

Build systems and package managers are integral components of the software development lifecycle, playing crucial roles in automating processes and managing dependencies. In the .NET environment, a variety of tools are available to facilitate efficient development, build, and deployment workflows. This report provides an overview of prominent build systems and package managers in the .NET ecosystem, along with examples and distinctions between these tools.

## 1. **MSBuild (Microsoft Build):**

**Overview:**
- MSBuild is the default build system for .NET applications.
- Developed by Microsoft, MSBuild is an open-source platform used to build, deploy, and publish .NET applications.
- It uses XML-based project files to define the build process.

**Key Features:**
- Extensible and customizable.
- Integrated into Visual Studio and can be used via the command line.

**Example:**
```xml
<Project ToolsVersion="4.0" xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/developer/msbuild/2003">
  <PropertyGroup>
    <OutputPath>bin\</OutputPath>
    <PlatformTarget>x64</PlatformTarget>
  </PropertyGroup>
  <ItemGroup>
    <Compile Include="Program.cs" />
  </ItemGroup>
</Project>
```

## 2. **NuGet:**

**Overview:**
- NuGet is a package manager for .NET that can also be used for dependency management and package restoration during builds.
- It is integrated with MSBuild and commonly used in combination with other build systems.

**Key Features:**
- Manages packages and their dependencies.
- Supports package creation and publishing.

**Example:**
```xml
<ItemGroup>
  <PackageReference Include="PackageName" Version="1.0.0" />
</ItemGroup>
```

## 3. **Cake:**

**Overview:**
- Cake is a cross-platform build automation framework for .NET applications.
- It uses a C#-based scripting language to define build tasks.

**Key Features:**
- Supports parallel builds.
- Easily extensible with add-ins.

**Example:**
```csharp
Task("Build")
  .Does(() =>
{
  MSBuild("./src/YourApp.sln");
});
```

## 4. **TeamCity:**

**Overview:**
- TeamCity is a continuous integration and build server developed by JetBrains.
- It supports building and deploying .NET applications among other languages.

**Key Features:**
- Integration with various version control systems.
- Provides powerful build configuration and customization.

**Example:**
Configuration in the TeamCity UI.

## 5. **Azure DevOps (formerly Visual Studio Team Services):**

**Overview:**
- Azure DevOps provides a set of development tools for building, testing, and deploying applications.
- It supports building and releasing .NET applications through pipelines.

**Key Features:**
- Integration with Git repositories.
- Pipeline configuration using YAML or visual designer.

**Example:**
Azure DevOps Pipeline Configuration in YAML.

## Build System vs. Package Manager:

1. **Build System:**
   - **Purpose:** Automates the compilation and build processes.
   - **Functionality:** Compiles source code, manages dependencies, executes tests, and produces executable artifacts.
   - **Integration:** Typically integrated into the build process, often leveraging package managers for dependency resolution.

2. **Package Manager:**
   - **Purpose:** Simplifies the management and distribution of external libraries and tools.
   - **Functionality:** Manages packages, resolves and installs dependencies, facilitates package discovery, and supports versioning.
   - **Integration:** Used in conjunction with build systems to fetch and integrate external dependencies during the build process.

## Graduation Project Implementation:

As we embark on our graduation project to implement a web marketplace, we will leverage the robust capabilities of **Azure DevOps** as our chosen build system. Azure DevOps seamlessly integrates with Git repositories, providing a comprehensive set of tools for building, testing, and deploying .NET applications. The decision to use Azure DevOps is driven by its user-friendly interface, YAML-based pipeline configuration, and extensive support for continuous integration and delivery. This choice aligns with our goal to streamline the development process, enhance collaboration, and ensure a smooth and efficient deployment of our web marketplace application.
